MemRE is a lightweight Windows memory editor you can inject (or attach) into any running process to take control of in-application values. Guided “First Scan” & “Next Scan” workflows help you pinpoint addresses in seconds, while built-in pointer scanning (including Unreal Engine’s GWorld) resolves dynamic offsets for you. Customize hotkeys, monitor real-time logs, and export with one click to Cheat Engine (.CT) or our native table format.  
###### Precompiled download comes with MemRE and MemRE Loader.
